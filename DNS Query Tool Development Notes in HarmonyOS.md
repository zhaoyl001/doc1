# DNS Query Tool Development Notes in HarmonyOS

## About HarmonyOS 5
HarmonyOS 5 (also known as HarmonyOS Next) represents a revolutionary step in the evolution of Huawei's distributed operating system. As someone who has been following its development closely, I can attest to the remarkable improvements in this version. The system's microkernel architecture not only enhances security but also provides unprecedented flexibility in cross-device collaboration. What excites me most about HarmonyOS 5 is its focus on developer experience - the new ArkTS language, enhanced UI components, and improved debugging tools have made development much more efficient. The distributed capabilities allow us to create truly seamless experiences across different devices, from smartphones to tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices.

## About the Author
I am a dedicated HarmonyOS developer based in China, with over three years of experience in the ecosystem. My journey with HarmonyOS began with its early versions, and I've witnessed its remarkable evolution. As a developer who has contributed to several open-source HarmonyOS projects, I've gained valuable insights into its architecture and best practices. I'm particularly passionate about network tools and DNS management, which led me to develop this comprehensive DNS query module. Through my blog and GitHub repositories, I've been sharing my experiences and helping other developers navigate the exciting world of HarmonyOS development.

## Preface
Recently, while developing the HarmonyOS Developer Toolbox, we wanted to add a DNS query feature. This feature is mainly used to query domain name resolution, such as A records, AAAA records, CNAME records, etc. Initially, we thought it would be complicated, but we found that HarmonyOS has good support for DNS queries, and we could implement it directly using system APIs. After a few adjustments, the basic functionality was ready.

## I. Feature Description

### 1.1 Main Features
- A record query (IPv4 address)
- AAAA record query (IPv6 address)
- CNAME record query (alias)
- MX record query (mail server)
- TXT record query (text)
- Batch query support
- Detailed record display

### 1.2 Interface Features
- Domain name input field
- Record type selection
- Query result display
- Favorites support
- Usage instructions

## II. Implementation Process

### 2.1 Query Principle

DNS query is essentially sending requests to DNS servers:

1. A Record Query
   - Query domain's IPv4 address
   - Returns one or more IPs
   - Example: baidu.com returns 39.156.66.10

2. AAAA Record Query
   - Query domain's IPv6 address
   - Returns IPv6 format address
   - Example: ipv6.google.com

3. CNAME Record Query
   - Query domain's alias
   - Returns another domain name
   - Example: www.baidu.com points to baidu.com

4. MX Record Query
   - Query mail server
   - Returns mail server domain
   - Example: gmail.com's mail server

5. TXT Record Query
   - Query text record
   - Returns any text information
   - Example: domain verification information

### 2.2 Code Implementation

```typescript
@Entry
@Component
struct DnsQuery {
  @State domain: string = '';           // Domain to query
  @State isQuerying: boolean = false;   // Query status
  @State queryType: DnsRecordType = DnsRecordType.A;  // Record type
  @State queryResults: string[] = [];   // Query results
  @State isError: boolean = false;      // Error status

  // Start query
  private async startQuery(): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.domain) {
      DnsQuery.toast('Please enter a domain name');
      return;
    }

    try {
      this.isQuerying = true;
      this.queryResults = [];
      this.isError = false;

      // Execute DNS query
      const results = await NetworkService.dnsLookup(this.domain, this.queryType);
      this.queryResults = Array.isArray(results) ? results : [results];

      if (this.queryResults.length === 0) {
        this.isError = true;
        DnsQuery.toast('No DNS records found');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      this.isError = true;
      this.queryResults = [`Query failed: ${error?.message || 'Unknown error'}`];
      DnsQuery.toast('DNS query failed');
    } finally {
      this.isQuerying = false;
    }
  }

  // Format query result
  private formatQueryResult(result: string): string {
    if (result.startsWith('Not found') || result.startsWith('Query failed')) {
      return result;
    }

    switch (this.queryType) {
      case DnsRecordType.A:
        return `📍 IP Address: ${result}`;
      case DnsRecordType.AAAA:
        return `🌐 IPv6 Address: ${result}`;
      case DnsRecordType.CNAME:
        return `🔄 Alias Points to: ${result}`;
      case DnsRecordType.MX:
        return `📧 ${result}`;
      case DnsRecordType.TXT:
        return `📝 Text Record: ${result}`;
      default:
        return result;
    }
  }
}
```

## III. Development Experience

### 3.1 Problems Encountered

1. Query Timeout
   - Problem: Some domains query too slowly
   - Solution: Set reasonable timeout period

2. Result Parsing
   - Problem: Different record types have different formats
   - Solution: Handle each type separately

3. Error Handling
   - Problem: Query failure messages not user-friendly
   - Solution: Optimize error messages

4. Interface Refresh
   - Problem: Results not updating timely
   - Solution: Optimize state management

### 3.2 Optimization Suggestions

1. Query Optimization
   - Support more record types
   - Add query history
   - Support batch queries

2. Performance Optimization
   - Optimize query speed
   - Reduce memory usage
   - Release resources promptly

3. User Experience
   - Add query history
   - Support result sharing
   - Optimize animations

4. Security
   - Validate domain format
   - Limit query frequency
   - Protect user privacy

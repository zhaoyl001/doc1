# IPv6 Subnet Calculator Development Notes in HarmonyOS

## About HarmonyOS 5
HarmonyOS 5 (also known as HarmonyOS Next) represents a revolutionary step in the evolution of Huawei's distributed operating system. As someone who has been following its development closely, I can attest to the remarkable improvements in this version. The system's microkernel architecture not only enhances security but also provides unprecedented flexibility in cross-device collaboration. What excites me most about HarmonyOS 5 is its focus on developer experience - the new ArkTS language, enhanced UI components, and improved debugging tools have made development much more efficient. The distributed capabilities allow us to create truly seamless experiences across different devices, from smartphones to tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices.

## About the Author
I am a dedicated HarmonyOS developer based in China, with over three years of experience in the ecosystem. My journey with HarmonyOS began with its early versions, and I've witnessed its remarkable evolution. As a developer who has contributed to several open-source HarmonyOS projects, I've gained valuable insights into its architecture and best practices. I'm particularly passionate about network tools and subnet management, which led me to develop this comprehensive IPv6 subnet calculator module. Through my blog and GitHub repositories, I've been sharing my experiences and helping other developers navigate the exciting world of HarmonyOS development.

## Basic Knowledge

Let's first understand IPv6 addresses and subnets:

1. What is an IPv6 Address
   - 128-bit address format
   - Written in hexadecimal
   - 8 groups of 16 bits
   - Groups separated by colons
   - Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

2. IPv6 Address Types
   - Global Unicast: 2000::/3
   - Unique Local: fc00::/7
   - Link Local: fe80::/10
   - Multicast: ff00::/8
   - Loopback: ::1/128

3. IPv6 Subnetting
   - Uses prefix length notation
   - Example: /64 means first 64 bits are network
   - Common prefix lengths: /48, /56, /64
   - Each subnet typically /64

4. Address Compression
   - Leading zeros in groups can be omitted
   - One or more groups of zeros can be replaced with ::
   - Example: 2001:db8::1

5. Address Validation
   - Must be valid hexadecimal
   - Must have correct number of groups
   - Must follow compression rules
   - Must be within valid ranges

## Preface
Recently, while developing the HarmonyOS Developer Toolbox, we wanted to add an IPv6 subnet calculator feature. This feature is mainly used to calculate subnet information for IPv6 addresses, such as network address, broadcast address, and available host count. Initially, we thought it would be similar to IPv4, but we found that IPv6 has its own unique characteristics and challenges.

## I. Feature Description

### 1.1 Main Features
- Calculate network address
- Calculate broadcast address
- Calculate available hosts
- Calculate subnet mask
- Support various IPv6 formats
- Display address type
- Support prefix length

### 1.2 Interface Features
- IPv6 address input field
- One-click copy results
- Display detailed calculations
- Favorites support
- Usage instructions

## II. Implementation Process

### 2.1 Calculation Principle

IPv6 subnet calculation involves bitwise operations on 128-bit addresses:

1. Network Address Calculation
   - AND operation between IP and subnet mask
   - Example: 2001:db8::1/64
   - Network address is 2001:db8::

2. Broadcast Address Calculation
   - Set all host bits to 1
   - Example: 2001:db8::/64
   - Broadcast address is 2001:db8::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff

3. Available Host Count Calculation
   - 2^(128-prefix length)
   - Example: /64 is 2^64 hosts

4. Subnet Mask Calculation
   - Generated based on prefix length
   - Example: /64 is ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000

5. Address Type Determination
   - Check first bits of address
   - Determine if global, local, or special

### 2.2 Code Implementation

  @State ipAddress: string = '';           // IP to calculate
  @State networkMask: string = '';         // Network mask
  @State networkAddress: string = '';      // Network address
  @State subnetMask: string = '';          // Subnet mask

      // Calculate broadcast address
      const broadcastParts = this.calculateBroadcastAddress(networkParts, prefix);
      this.broadcastAddress = this.formatIPv6(broadcastParts);

      // Calculate available host range
      const firstHostParts = [...networkParts];
      firstHostParts[7] += 1;
      this.firstHost = this.formatIPv6(firstHostParts);

      const lastHostParts = [...broadcastParts];
      lastHostParts[7] -= 1;
      this.lastHost = this.formatIPv6(lastHostParts);

      // Calculate available host count
      this.totalHosts = this.calculateHostCount(prefix);

      // Determine address type
      this.addressType = this.determineAddressType(ipParts);

    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Calculation failed:', err);
      throw err;
